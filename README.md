# Termennetwerk Demo

Before deploying, point the client in `src/workers/worker.js` on line 6 to the right datasets.
Running `docker-compose build; docker-compose` up will then build the demo, and host it on port 80.
To serve the demo on a different port, simply change the mappings in `docker-compose.yml`.
